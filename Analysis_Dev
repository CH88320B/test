Analysis and Design (10-20% of time):
Fully understand the structure of the XPM and SDoc.
Identify all classes and properties that need to be mapped.
Design the C# classes that will reflect the SDoc structure and define the mappings with Mapster.

Implementation of the Mapping (40-50% of the time):
Write all C# classes and mappings with Mapster.
Test and debug the mappings to make sure they fit the requirements.



AWS Lambda development (20-30% of time):
Create an AWS Lambda project in C#.
Implement the conversion logic using the previously defined classes and mappings.
Configure Lambda triggers and access policies.
Testing and Debugging (10-20% of the time):

Test the Lambda function in a local environment.
Perform integration testing to ensure that input and output data is correct.

Deployment (10-20% of time):

Package and upload the Lambda function to AWS.
Configure the necessary environment variables and permissions.
Test again in the AWS environment.


Optimization and Learning (10-20% of time):

Evaluate the performance of the function and optimize as needed.
Learn from any bugs or problems encountered and improve the implementation.
